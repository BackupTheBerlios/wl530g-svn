09/23/06

  * rc: added new event scripts: /etc/on_wan_up_begin.sh /etc/on_wan_up_end.sh /etc/on_wan_down_begin.sh /etc/on_wan_down_begin.sh which all invoke their /jffs/etc/ counterparts.
  * rc: a little code cleanup.
  * fs: added on_wan event scripts.
  * httpd: fixed 'save log'.
  * httpd: faster log view.
  * httpd: other cleanup.
  * httpd: disabled console debug messages.
  * kernel: some config changes.
  * other misc. changes.

09/22/06

  * busybox: included verbose applet usage messages. 
  * busybox: included gzip.
  * busybox: rmmod is back. I had to fix a build error with busybox 1.2.1's implementation.
  * busybox: turned OFF 'build all sources at once', which surprisingly resulted in a smaller binary.
  * rc: now does proper scan for version info in /dev/mtd0 again.
  * rc: removed infosvr startup.
  * modules: included lockd.o.
  * modules: included nbd.o.
  * www: removal of a bit more unused code (from other models).
  * www: added revision number and build date near 'Liberated Libertas' image (Title.asp).
  * motd: added build date and revision number to motd/banner.
  * an assortment of other things i forgot to make note of.

09/20/06
  * added new logread code to httpd for reading the syslogd circular buffer (a.k.a. log viewing now works in web UI).
  * added /etc/init.d/S20syslogd to start/stop syslogd. 
  * rc now uses /etc/init.d/S20syslogd to start syslogd.
  * httpd now clears syslogd circular buffer through syslogd start/restart.
  * added symlink from /www/tmp to /tmp/www for adding your own temporary web pages.
  * added symlink from /www/jffs to /jffs/www for adding yur own persistant web pages.
  * new syslogd variables are: syslogd_logsize_kb to set circular buffer size and syslogd_mark_min to set mark interval time (set to 0 to disable).
  * reduced default circular buffer size to 16KB (syslogd_logsize_kb).
  * changed default syslogd mark time to 0/disabled (syslogd_mark_min).
  * removed 'cpu' utility from base firmware image to an installable package.
  * fixed default incorrectly handled in /etc/init.d/S10conntrack. This would cause web UI to not show default value if max_conntrack unset.
  * increased JFFS2 size by 128KB.

09/19/06 (3)
  * important fix: new syslogd didn't have max log size set correctly. This would cause all available RAM to eventually be eaten up by syslog.log. This fix adds proper circular buffer support. Read the log with 'logread'. Web UI needs updating as well, I'll do that shortly.

09/19/06 (2)

  * fixed lame msh error in /etc/init.d/S10conntrack.
  * fixed telnetd and mvmfgd path in inetd.conf.

09/19/06

  * added 'max_conntrack' nvram variable to set maximum number of connections (default value is 1008).
  * added web UI setting for maximum connections in 'IP settings/Misc'.
  * changed network parameters to common p2p friendly values (same that will be used in OpenWrt WR RC6). See /etc/sysctl.conf.
  * create /etc/groups and /etc/passwd from within rc instead of /etc/init.d/S10login (deleted).
  * add /jffs/etc/on_ppp_up and /jffs/etc/on_ppp_down for invocation when a PPP connection is established and closed, respectively.
  * set /proc/sys/kernel/hostname appropriately at startup.
  * set initial ramfs size to 1.5MB (was 2MB).
  * added /rom folder.
  * unlinked /mnt from /tmp.
  * busybox: mount (NFS) - set default rsize and wsize to 8KB each - was 32KB each.
  * busybox: added ftpput and ftpget.
  * busybox.find: add -xdev and -type options.
  * busybox.grep: add regex (egrep) and context switches.
  * added stand-alone cat, echo, rmdir, rm, yes, true, false, date, uname, whoami, pwd, and basename. Removed these utilities from busybox. This results in less RAM usage since an entire instance of busybox need not be created when these simple applets are run.
  * changed firmware upgrade failure message in web UI to suggest rescue mode and list free RAM as a possible cause.
  * clipped out some useless code in general.js.
  * many other misc. changes and additions.

09/17/06

  * addition: busybox 1.2.1 is here with all the beloved gifts it has to offer! Almost all existing applets enhanced in some way or another (i.e. tab file/dirname completion), and many new applets are available (i.e. netstat).
  * addition: added gpio user utility to enable/disable/poll gpio interrupts.
  * change: created a small (8KB) reboot tool instead of using busybox's built in one.
  * fix: much needed file system cleanup.
  * note: this build will not clear your jffs2 if upgrade from 09/16/06 build (it will from any others).


09/16/06

  * addition: erase of jffs after firmware upgrade (fixes corruption).  
  * change: kernel: removed 'kernel module loader' (not insmod, auto-loading by the kernel).
  * change: kernel: a few minor optimizations and fixes to the mtd driver mapping code.
  * change: increased jffs2 size by 64KB.
  * change: changed web UI top graphic.
  * fix: fixed firmware upgrade from web UI.
  * fix: restore system defaults in web UI (mtd device # change).
  * other misc. changes/fixes/additions.

09/15/06

  * changed name to Liberated Libertas Firmware (LLF) and edited MOTD accordingly.
  * added invocation of /etc/preinit before any other services get started (in contrast, the init.d scripts are executed after all services get started). The default /etc/preinit script invokes /jffs/etc/preinit as well, and also is responsible for mounting the jffs2 partition. Hence, /etc/init.d/S20jffs2 was removed.
  * added 17 new nvram variables to allow more extensive configuration of the wlan interface via hostapd.conf.
  * busybox: ported 'ls' from 1.2.1 over to the current 0.60. Amongst other things, color typing is available and shown by default. I did this because I'm still having a few issues with the Busybox 1.2.1 msh and ash shells.
  * added /mnt directory (symlink to /tmp).
  * removed 't' test utility, whose purpose is unknown, but it appears to be unused.
  * increased jffs2 size by 64KB. You need to run 'mtd erase /dev/mtd2' after installation of this version (sorry).
  * renamed mtd partitions to more terse and accurate names.
  * other misc. changes.

09/13/06 (3)

  * fixed bad busybox in last copy.. 
  * included cpu utility (reports cpu utilization).

09/13/06 (2)

  * included previously missing PPP* modules, so PPP/PPPOE support should work now.
  * fixed missing vi (had been over-written by old busybox symlink..sigh).
  * fixed /jffs/etc/init.d scripts not being executed (old /jffs2 directory name was been used).
  * reworked mtd mappings and removed write protection on mtd0.  
  * increased jffs2 size by 64KB (note: run 'mtd erase /dev/mtd2' to erase the jffs2 partition, forcing re-initialization of its data structures).

09/12/06
	
  * fixed productid/firmver bug in last build, which had resulted in various problems.
  * fixed WLAN led being 'broken' in last build.
  * added mtd utility from openwrt (allows write/erase of mtd partitions).
  * which reminds me, I enabled RO mtd driver protection on mtd0 and mtd1 in the last build.
  * removed mtd1 mtd driver write protection, mtd0 protection still in effect.
  * really expanded JFFS2 size by 64KB (last build increase was offset by a 64KB decrease when making room for nvram area). Still haven't written the code to dynamically determine available size.
  * fixed inconsequential but disturbing  crams: wrong magic  and  VFS: can't find ext2..  startup messages, which were because  -t jffs2  wasn't specified when mounting the jffs2 partition, causing it to try all filesystem drivers sequentially until success.

09/10/06 (3)

  * added dedicated nvram mtd partition, mtd3, size 64KB.
  * moved mfg_data mtd partition to mtd4 (still at same flash offset).
  * enabled allowance for missing mfg_data mtd partition, falls back to /etc/mfg_data.
  * increased size of jffs2 partition by 64KB (soon will be dynamically determined).
  * renamed /jffs2 mount to /jffs.
  * added /jffs/etc/init.d/S* startup script support.
  * fixed missing busybox applets in last build (like chmod). Whoops.
  * more optimal busybox.
  * added smbfs.o kernel module for mounting samba file systems. Use insmod to load.
