  * fixed bad busybox in last copy.. 
  * included cpu utility (reports cpu utilization).

  * included previously missing PPP* modules, so PPP/PPPOE support should work now.
  * fixed missing vi (had been over-written by old busybox symlink..sigh).
  * fixed /jffs/etc/init.d scripts not being executed (old /jffs2 directory name was been used).
  * reworked mtd mappings and removed write protection on mtd0.  
  * increased jffs2 size by 64KB (note: run 'mtd erase /dev/mtd2' to erase the jffs2 partition, forcing re-initialization of its data structures).

  * fixed productid/firmver bug in last build, which had resulted in various problems.
  * fixed WLAN led being 'broken' in last build.
  * added mtd utility from openwrt (allows write/erase of mtd partitions).
  * which reminds me, I enabled RO mtd driver protection on mtd0 and mtd1 in the last build.
  * removed mtd1 mtd driver write protection, mtd0 protection still in effect.
  * really expanded JFFS2 size by 64KB (last build increase was offset by a 64KB decrease when making room for nvram area). Still haven't written the code to dynamically determine available size.
  * fixed inconsequential but disturbing "crams: wrong magic" and "VFS: can't find ext2.." startup messages, which were because "-t jffs2" wasn't specified when mounting the jffs2 partition, causing it to try all filesystem drivers sequentially until success.

  * added dedicated nvram mtd partition, mtd3, size 64KB.
  * moved mfg_data mtd partition to mtd4 (still at same flash offset).
  * enabled allowance for missing mfg_data mtd partition, falls back to /etc/mfg_data.
  * increased size of jffs2 partition by 64KB (soon will be dynamically determined).
  * renamed /jffs2 mount to /jffs.
  * added /jffs/etc/init.d/S* startup script support.
  * fixed missing busybox applets in last build (like chmod). Whoops.
  * more optimal busybox.
  * added smbfs.o kernel module for mounting samba file systems. Use insmod to load.
