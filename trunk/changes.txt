Known Issues:

  * upgrade from web UI doesn't work (yes, still).

09/15/06

  * changed name to Liberated Libertas Firmware (LLF) and edited MOTD accordingly.
  * added invocation of /etc/preinit before any other services get started (in contrast, the init.d scripts are executed after all services get started). The default /etc/preinit script invokes /jffs/etc/preinit as well, and also is responsible for mounting the jffs2 partition. Hence, /etc/init.d/S20jffs2 was removed.
  * added 17 new nvram variables to allow more extensive configuration of the wlan interface via hostapd.conf.
  * busybox: ported 'ls' from 1.2.1 over to the current 0.60. Amongst other things, color typing is available and shown by default. I did this because I'm still having a few issues with the Busybox 1.2.1 msh and ash shells.
  * added /mnt directory (symlink to /tmp).
  * removed 't' test utility, whose purpose is unknown, but it appears to be unused.
  * increased jffs2 size by 64KB. You need to run 'mtd erase /dev/mtd2' after installation of this version (sorry).
  * renamed mtd partitions to more terse and accurate names.
  * other misc. changes.

The new nvram variables are below. They are unset by default, so don't expect to see them in 'nvram show' unless you set them.

  * fixed bad busybox in last copy.. 
  * included cpu utility (reports cpu utilization).

09/13/06 (2)

  * included previously missing PPP* modules, so PPP/PPPOE support should work now.
  * fixed missing vi (had been over-written by old busybox symlink..sigh).
  * fixed /jffs/etc/init.d scripts not being executed (old /jffs2 directory name was been used).
  * reworked mtd mappings and removed write protection on mtd0.  
  * increased jffs2 size by 64KB (note: run 'mtd erase /dev/mtd2' to erase the jffs2 partition, forcing re-initialization of its data structures).

09/12/06
	
  * fixed productid/firmver bug in last build, which had resulted in various problems.
  * fixed WLAN led being 'broken' in last build.
  * added mtd utility from openwrt (allows write/erase of mtd partitions).
  * which reminds me, I enabled RO mtd driver protection on mtd0 and mtd1 in the last build.
  * removed mtd1 mtd driver write protection, mtd0 protection still in effect.
  * really expanded JFFS2 size by 64KB (last build increase was offset by a 64KB decrease when making room for nvram area). Still haven't written the code to dynamically determine available size.
  * fixed inconsequential but disturbing  crams: wrong magic  and  VFS: can't find ext2..  startup messages, which were because  -t jffs2  wasn't specified when mounting the jffs2 partition, causing it to try all filesystem drivers sequentially until success.

09/10/06 (3)

  * added dedicated nvram mtd partition, mtd3, size 64KB.
  * moved mfg_data mtd partition to mtd4 (still at same flash offset).
  * enabled allowance for missing mfg_data mtd partition, falls back to /etc/mfg_data.
  * increased size of jffs2 partition by 64KB (soon will be dynamically determined).
  * renamed /jffs2 mount to /jffs.
  * added /jffs/etc/init.d/S* startup script support.
  * fixed missing busybox applets in last build (like chmod). Whoops.
  * more optimal busybox.
  * added smbfs.o kernel module for mounting samba file systems. Use insmod to load.
